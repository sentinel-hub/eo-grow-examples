# GEM monitoring


## Introduction

_TODO_

## Requirements

The example relies on [SentinelHub service](https://sentinel-hub.com) capabilities to download Sentinel-2 imagery, in 
particular using the large-scale batch processing API to construct data cubes. The batch processing allows to download 
images over large Areas of Interest in a very fast and efficient manner. The data is automatically stored in S3 
buckets, which need to be properly configured.

For (optional) access to the weather data, the example relies on [meteoblue](https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather-api) 
weather API.


## Installation and running of the example

The example consists of two demonstrations:
  1) Full (but generic) EO workflow using `eo-grow` with Ray clusters on AWS infrastructure, which is the most 
cost-effective solution to use for large-scale processing
  2) A slimmed-down EO workflow using a Jupyter notebook using `eo-grow` without Ray, which is small enough to be run
on a laptop

Both demonstrations are self-contained. To set up the working environment, the following should be sufficient:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, we invite the user to:   
  1) Head over to [`using eo-grow with Ray`](./eogrow_ray.md) for details about full large-scale processing demo
  2) open the [`example notebook`](./example_notebook.ipynb) for running small example on your laptop.


## Questions and Issues
