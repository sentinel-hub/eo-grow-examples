# eo-grow-examples

**Earth Observation framework for scaled-up processing [`eo-grow`](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/eo-grow) in action.**

Analyzing Earth Observation (EO) data is complex and solutions often require custom tailored algorithms. In the EO domain most problems come with an additional challenge: *How do we apply the solution on a larger scale?*

## Examples

The examples in this repository are fully self contained in corresponding sub-directories. Each example has instructions on how to set-up a working environment, and (typically) an end-to-end notebook that user can tweak according to their needs.

Current examples are limited to [`GlobalEarthMonitor`](./GEM/README.md) spot-mode monitoring, but more will follow.


## Installation and running of examples

To run the examples provided in this repository, the user has to clone the repository first, and then follow the instruction given in the `README.md` of each particular example.

```
git clone https://github.com/sentinel-hub/eo-grow-examples.git
```

## Documentation

The documentation of each example should be given in the corresponding `README.md` files. Documentations for the main building blocks of the examples can be found here:
 * [`eo-grow`](https://eo-grow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
 * [`eo-learn`](https://eo-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
 * [`sentinelhub-py`](https://sentinelhub-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
